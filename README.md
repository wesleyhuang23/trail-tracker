Project for Engineering Candidate Wesley Huang

Create a simple web app using AngularJS (or similar JS framework) to display and edit a list of lat/lon coordinates representing [Pacific Crest Trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail) mile markers on a Google Map.

Requirements:

* Create an interface with Google Maps on the left and a mile marker UI on the right
* Manually load a list of PCT mile marker lat/lon coordinates into the browser's local storage
* Add, edit, delete PCT mile marker lat/lon coordinates from local storage using mile marker UI
* Update Google Maps display of PCT based on changes to PCT mile markers in local storage
* Search for nearest PCT mile marker given an arbitrary lat/lon (hint: Haversine)

The intention of this project is simply to give you a chance to solve a realistic programming problem on your own time, rather than sweating it out in front of a whiteboard. You can spend as long or as little time on this as you like. Feel free to impress us.
